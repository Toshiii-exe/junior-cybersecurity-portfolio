# Case Study 01 – Information-Stealing Malware Traffic

This case study examines network traffic captured during a simulated malware-related incident.  
The analysis focuses on identifying abnormal communication patterns commonly associated with information-stealing malware.

The purpose of this case study is to demonstrate a SOC-style approach to:
- Analysing suspicious network traffic
- Understanding protocol behaviour linked to malware activity
- Identifying high-level indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Supporting detection and incident response decisions

## Scope of Analysis
- Network traffic analysis using PCAP files
- Protocol-level inspection (e.g., DNS, HTTP, TCP)
- Host behaviour observation
- No payload extraction or malware execution

All analysis was conducted in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes.
