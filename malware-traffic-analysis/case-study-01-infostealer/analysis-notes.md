# Analysis Notes – Malware-Related Network Traffic

## Overview
This analysis reviews network traffic captured during a suspected malware-related incident.  
The objective is to identify abnormal communication patterns and behaviours that may indicate malicious activity.

The PCAP analysed contains traffic characteristics consistent with known information-stealing malware families.

---

## Traffic Overview
The capture contains a mixture of standard network traffic alongside anomalous patterns.  
While common protocols such as DNS and HTTP are present, certain flows exhibit unusual frequency and timing that deviate from expected baseline behaviour.

Key observations include:
- Repeated outbound connections from a single host
- Short-lived sessions with regular intervals
- Communication patterns not aligned with normal user-driven browsing activity

---

## Protocol Analysis
### DNS Behaviour
DNS traffic shows repeated domain resolution attempts that do not resemble typical user-generated queries.  
The frequency and structure of these requests suggest automated behaviour rather than manual interaction.

### HTTP Behaviour
HTTP traffic includes outbound requests with minimal response payloads.  
Such behaviour can indicate beaconing activity, where an infected host periodically communicates with external infrastructure.

---

## Host Behaviour Analysis
The affected host demonstrates persistent outbound communication over a sustained period.  
This behaviour is indicative of background processes rather than legitimate foreground applications.

No evidence of large file transfers was observed, which aligns with stealthy data exfiltration techniques commonly associated with information-stealing malware.

---

## Indicators of Compromise (High-Level)
The following high-level indicators were identified during analysis:
- Periodic outbound connections with consistent timing
- Automated DNS queries lacking typical user context
- Repeated HTTP requests with limited payload exchange

Specific IP addresses, domains, and payload data have been intentionally excluded.

---

## Security Implications
Traffic patterns observed in this case study highlight how malware can operate quietly within a network without generating obvious alerts.

Without proper monitoring and traffic analysis, such activity may remain undetected for extended periods.

---

## Detection & Mitigation Takeaways
- Establish baseline network traffic behaviour
- Monitor for periodic outbound beaconing patterns
- Correlate DNS and HTTP activity with endpoint telemetry
- Use IDS/IPS and SIEM solutions to flag anomalous traffic patterns

---

## Conclusion
This case study demonstrates the value of network traffic analysis in identifying stealthy malware-related activity.  
Even in the absence of payload inspection, behavioural indicators at the network level can provide critical insight for incident detection and response.
