# Malware-Related Network Traffic Analysis

This section contains structured case studies focused on analysing malware-related network traffic using PCAP files.

The goal of these case studies is to demonstrate a defensive, SOC-oriented approach to:
- Identifying abnormal network behaviour
- Analysing protocol-level communication patterns
- Recognising high-level indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Supporting detection and incident response activities

All analysis is conducted in controlled lab environments for educational purposes.  
No malware samples, payloads, or live attack infrastructure are included.
