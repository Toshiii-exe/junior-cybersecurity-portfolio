# Malware-Related Network Traffic Analysis

This section contains structured case studies focused on analysing malware-related network traffic using PCAP files.

All case studies follow a defensive, SOC-oriented methodology and focus on behavioural indicators rather than malware execution or payload analysis.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 01 – Information-Stealing Malware Traffic
- Focus: Periodic outbound communication, beaconing behaviour, and protocol anomalies
- Techniques: DNS analysis, HTTP behaviour inspection, host activity observation
- Outcome: Identification of high-level indicators consistent with stealthy data exfiltration malware

Additional case studies will be added over time to cover other malware categories and attack behaviours.

## Methodology
- Behaviour-based traffic analysis
- Protocol-level inspection
- High-level IOC identification
- Detection and monitoring considerations

All analysis is conducted in controlled lab environments for educational purposes.  
No malware samples, payloads, or live attack infrastructure are included.
