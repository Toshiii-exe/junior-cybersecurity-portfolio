# Network Traffic Analysis – Wireshark

This section focuses on analysing network traffic using PCAP files to identify anomalous behaviour, suspicious communication patterns, and potential indicators of compromise.

The work presented here follows a defensive, SOC-oriented approach and emphasises behavioural analysis over payload inspection.

## Areas Covered
- Protocol analysis (DNS, HTTP, TCP)
- Host behaviour analysis
- Malware-related traffic patterns
- High-level indicator identification
- Detection and monitoring considerations

## Structure
- `malware-traffic-analysis/`
  - Case studies analysing malware-related network traffic
  - Each case study follows a structured SOC-style methodology

All analysis is conducted in controlled lab environments for educational purposes.
